Failure to provide a complete answer may result in point deduction.\n","\n","1. In the first web collection we needed to ensure that there were no empty rows that were being added to the dataframe. This would ensure that the data being added to our dataframe is valuable and not an empty line which could cause issues when using the dataframe in the analysis phase. This was handled by using an if statement to ensure that the data was useful and not empty.\n","\n","2. The webpage that we used gave the 25th and 75th SAT score percentile in a single column, however that would not be as useful because it would be difficult to graph for analysis. As a result the column needed to be split into 2 columns, one representing the 25th percentile and one representing the 75th percentile.\n","\n","3. In our dataset colleges were repeated multiple times for each major and level of degree. Inorder to handle this inconsistency and consolidate each college to having only 1 row each we have to perform a groupby and also determine how to aggregate the values that are in different columns. Hence, we chose to take the mean values of most of the columns that we chose to include as well as the first occurrence for some of the columns such as control which tells whether it is a private, public, foreign, etc.\n","\n","4. There are many cells that have the value PrivacySuppressed in our dataset. To handle this inconsistency we replace them all with nan values to allow for calculations and functions to still take place.\n","\n","5. After grouping the dataset by college, we noticed that there were many colleges that had no valuable data as a result of the data that we wanted being restricted and thus PrivacySupressed. As a result we took the rows that have 17 or more NaNs and removing those rows.\n","\n","6. For the second web collection using api, there were too much data that quering did not work and continuously gave 'NaN' values for everything. Thus, instead of using a query, we decided to obtain the college name and average household income through a for loop which went through every page of the api. This helped successfully remove values which were not needed. Some colleges did not have data for the average household income, thus we removed them and formatted the obtained values into a Panda dataframe, then converted it into a csv file.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"giwdtk_z-D69"},"outputs":[],"source":[]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.8.3"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
